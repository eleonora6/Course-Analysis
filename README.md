# Course-Analysis

To gain meaningful insights regarding sales and the student body, I conducted a thorough examination of the Course_Schedule_Data dataset. By carefully examining this dataset, I was able to identify trends and patterns that provide insight into student preferences. I investigated the fluctuation of the student population over time, identified courses with high demand, and determined which courses generated the highest revenue.
